.SH NAME
hsh \- a basic UNIX command line interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.RI [ input_file ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a minimalist UNIX command line interpreter that replicates basic shell functionality. It reads commands from the user, locates executables, and executes them in child processes.

When run interactively, the shell displays a prompt and waits for user input. When run non-interactively (via a pipe or script), it executes commands from standard input until end-of-file (EOF).

Each command is executed in a new process. The parent waits for the child to complete before displaying the next prompt.

.SH FEATURES
.TP
Displays a prompt
.RB ("#cisfun$") when input is from a terminal.
.TP
Executes commands using
.B execve (2)
and waits for completion.
.TP
Searches for executables using the
.B PATH
environment variable.
.TP
Handles absolute and relative paths.
.TP
Implements two built-in commands:
.B exit
and
.B env
(exit does not accept arguments).
.TP
Handles end-of-file (Ctrl+D) gracefully.
.TP
Displays error messages when a command cannot be executed.

.SH BUILTINS
.TP
.B exit
Exits the shell with the status of the last executed command. No arguments are supported.
.TP
.B env
Prints the current environment, one variable per line, in the form:
.RS
VAR=value
.RE
Variables are printed in the order provided by the operating system. The environment is not modified.

.SH USAGE
Run interactively:
.RS
$ ./hsh
#cisfun$ /bin/ls
AUTHORS  README.md  main.c  shell.c  shell.h  utils.c  man_1_simple_shell
#cisfun$ env
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin
#cisfun$ exit
.RE

Run non-interactively:
.RS
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
AUTHORS  README.md  main.c  shell.c  shell.h  utils.c  man_1_simple_shell
.RE

.SH RETURN VALUE
Exits with the status code of the last executed command. If no command was executed, exits with 0.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B PATH
Colon-separated list of directories to search for executables.
.TP
.B HOME
User's home directory.
.TP
.B PWD
Current working directory.

.SH FILES
.TP
.I /bin/sh
Standard system shell used as a reference.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP
.B ./hsh: 1: command: not found
Occurs when the entered command cannot be located in any directory listed in
.B PATH
or is not executable.
.TP
.B End-of-file (Ctrl+D)
Exits the shell gracefully.
.TP
.B Ctrl+C (SIGINT)
Interrupts the current command if running, or terminates the shell if no child process is active.

.SH EXAMPLES
.RS
$ ./hsh
#cisfun$ ls
